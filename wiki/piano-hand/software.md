## Subteams

### Actuation

The Actuation sub-team, as the name mentions, works on actuating the fingers with the help of controlling the servo motors and linear actuators. Work is also done on using states to determine the position and orientation of the hand to help hit keys on the piano.

### Junction

The Junction sub-team works on interfacing the MIDI values generated by the data sub-team to make it readable by the code processing of the Actuation sub-team. This involves developing the algorithm with states that is accessible for actuation and the API interface as well.
