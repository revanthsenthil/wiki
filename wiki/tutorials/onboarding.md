## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will outline the onboarding process.

One of the curcial first steps is determining your area of interest. Robotics requires knowledge from a wide variety of fields such as: engineering, computer science, physics, statistics and more. Because of this, ARC usually divides students into two categories of interest: software and hardware.

Choosing a specialty is by no means a limitation to what you can work on within ARC, but instead a starting place for acquiring the bare minimum of skills to contribute.

## Specializing

### Software

If you are interested in software, we recommend the following path:

TODO: Add basic software reqs (e.g. bash and git) to path

1. [Setup your development environment](/wiki/tutorials/setup-ros.md)
2. [Learn ROS through snake game](/wiki/tutorials/snake-tutorial.md)

### Hardware

If you are interested in hardware, we recommend the following path:

TODO: Determine path for hardware

1. [Setup your CAD environment](/wiki/tutorials/setup-cad.md)

## Contributing

After you have gone through your respective tutorials, you are ready to begin contributing within ARC. Start by looking at the ongoing projects. If a particular project catches your eye, reach out to the project manager about getting involved. If you feel ARC is missing a project that fits your interests, consider starting your own project.
